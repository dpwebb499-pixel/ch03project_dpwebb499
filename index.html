<img src="media/squidward.jpg" alt="squidward" width="250" height="200" class="noBorder">

<p> This is a picture of squidward, however the picture on the left is what is called a png Image.
    The picture on the right is a jpg image.
    The png image is a higher quality image but has a larger file size,
    the jpg image is a lower quality image but has a smaller file size.
    you can even see a slight difference in quality between the two images as the png image is slightly clearer.
